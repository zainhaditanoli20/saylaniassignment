<p>Ever imagined you could ski in Pakistan? Malam Jabba in KPK is the right choice. The only ski resort you would find in Pakistan. By only, it does not mean it is an ugly and ordinary last resort to experience your deepest temptations of skiing in only a desperate attempt. It also comprises of 2 Buddhist stupas, 6 monasteries that you would find around it. Evident of such monuments being present at such altitudes signifies that this area in KPK has been home to mankind for over 2000 years.</p>
<h2>Lake Saif-ul-Malook:</h2>

<p>Ranked 5th by The Guardian as one of the top attractions of Pakistan. This is one is a treat, one that would compel you to pat your eyes twice to acknowledge reality or that it isn’t a dream. Words can hardly be just to this place’s attraction. The sea green, clear as crystal, freezing water surface amid gigantic glaciers is one part of it. A classic fable goes about this area of a prince and a fairy queen still residing and dancing above water surface every month on 14th of lunar calendar. Should you get along with a local inhabitant by chance, they would certainly run you through this tale.</p>
<h2>Nathiagali:</h2>

<p>You must have heard about this one a lot. It is more about seeing this one rather, anyway. It is simply said that this area is a maze of scenic beauty. It’s a host of hiking and great weather that is a lot cooler because of its magnificent altitude. Nathiagali is located midway and an hour’s drive away from Abbottabad and Murree; double the time if you’re driving from Islamabad. Head out during May, June, July, and August, it would be best suited, since during these months the temperature is tolerable for a visitor generally in KPK. However, when you hear about fog here, take your steps back because visibility is reduced to a few feet only. Nothing like your hometown’s fog. Top attractions Pakistan can be scattered in hazards.</p>
<h2>Mushkpuri:</h2>

<p>Presenting nature; nothing like anything or anywhere you have seen before. Known to be the second highest hill of Galyat and located in the hilly areas of Abbottabad. Although there is an arduous journey of nearly 3 hours to the top, which takes your breath away – ascend like you have never had experienced before. Another trek follows from Dungagali to Mushkpuri, however, this one is more amiable and boasts an appealing sight of Ayubia National Park in KPK. Must explore the water pond at the top which casts a remarkable reflection of sky and trees. That is not it yet because a beautiful sight of Kashmir valley can also be seen from Mushkpuri top. So, basically, not only this breathtaking location offers you its intrinsic beauty but also glimpses of surrounding places – so much to offer in one place.</p>
